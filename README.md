## Steps to Run the code
1) Go to google colab/jupyter notebook/your prefered IDE
2) In the notebook I am reading the data kept in goolge drive under section 1.2. Replace it with your correct source of data.
3) You need to prepare train and test target label set similar to the target set I have in data/suicide.txt
4) import all other files(inits.py,layers.py,metrics.py,models.py,remove_words.py,train.py and utils.py) on to the root level, where the notebook is present.
5) Run it to see the results.
