## Steps to Run the code
- Go to google colab/jupyter notebook/your prefered IDE
- In the notebook I am reading the data kept in goolge drive under section 1.2. Replace it with your correct source of data.
- You need to prepare train and test target label set similar to the target set I have in data/suicide.txt
- import all other files(inits.py,layers.py,metrics.py,models.py,remove_words.py,train.py and utils.py) on to the root level, where the notebook is present.
- Run it to see the results.
